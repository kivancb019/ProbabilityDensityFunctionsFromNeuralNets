## Probability Density Functions (PDFs) from Neural Networks

Probability Density Functions (PDFs) have many applications in the Engieering Sciences, Industrial Engineering, Finance, and many other fields. They are used in regression type models which predict real valued numbers in a given range. The goal of the neural network model is to predict a real valued number but also provide a probability of that number. The PDF should add to 1. 

The general function is as follows:

*   y = f(x) + e(x)

where  f(x) is the function and e(x) is the noise or error. 

In an industrial process, you can learrn the pdf by comparing it to the real data of your target variable. This is called pdf shaping and it has many app,lication in stochastic control systems. 

The code in this repo (written in python) is the companion to the upcoming book:
